title: Hammerspoon
---

Recently, I started working with the OS X automation tool [Hammerspoon][Hammerspoon]. Hammerspoon is a bridge between your operation system and a Lua scripting engine. It exposes some powerful OS functionaility to the user that I had yet to find integrated in a single place. You can find a nice tutorial on getting started [here][GettingStarted].

I use Hammerspoon primarily for hotkeys and as an app and window manager (though it will never fully replace [Alfred][Alfred] for me). It really shines in window management though, because in addition to resizing windows, it can also reliable move windows between displays given an arbitray display setup.
